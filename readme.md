Project init by laravel 5.8
Live version is deployed on Heroku [here](https://portfolio-fst.sadiqeen.me/)
I didn't init database via migration. You need to import DB from SQL file [here](https://github.com/Sadiqeen/fst-web/tree/master/database/sqlfile)

 - To acces to Normal user (who can CRUD content) go to
`https://portfolio-fst.sadiqeen.me/admin`
Email : `test@test.com`
Password: `password`
 -  To acces to Administrator (who can interact with db) go to
`https://portfolio-fst.sadiqeen.me/admin`
Email : `admin@admin.com`
Password: `password`
